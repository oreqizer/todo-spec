# todo spec

A demo TODO app with a filesystem database. :scroll: For demonstrating testing. Has dark mode!

![Sneakpeek](docs/sneakpeek.png)

Based on **TodoMVC**, except I changed the design a little so it is actually visible.

Before running, create a `db.json` file at the root of the project with `[]` as its content.
